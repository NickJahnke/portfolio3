                <p class="card-text"> I spent my final years of college working with the staff of The Observer. It was exciting to be a part of the newsroom and work together with everyone to put out a quality product every week. I learned so much from my colleagues about the ins-and-outs of the news industry and had a great time doing it. As sports editor, I had the opportunity to learn how to manage a group of reporters and face the conflicts and issues to go along with that. From dealing with a reporter who wouldn’t take criticism or direction to a face off with the university’s sports media staff ultimately culminating in a protest for free speech, it was truly a unique experience. My favorite experience with The Observer was getting to travel with the staff to a journalism conference in Washington D.C., we attended a swath of session covering a myriad of topics and got to explore the capitol. It was a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity.   </p>

                <h1 class="card-title text-center">Pacific University Football</h1>
                <p class="card-text"> I played on Pacific University’s (PU) football team from 2014-16. As a Boxer football player, I enjoyed the camaraderie and responsibility that came with being part of the team. I was a key player for the Boxers and earned a starting position on the defensive line in my freshman year. My strength and speed elevated me beyond most of the upperclassmen on the team. In my second year, my starting role was locked in and I was a leader for the defensive line. During our last practice before the first game of the season, a 350 pound offensive lineman took a fall, pinning my leg and tearing my MCL in my left knee. Although I was able to quickly heal and played the rest of the season in a brace, I had done more damage than previously thought. After the season, I had surgery to repair my MCL, ACL and remove scar tissue in the knee. I made the decision then to avoid further damage and left the Boxers and PU as a whole.  </p>

                <p class="card-text"> During the summers of 2018 and 2019 I worked on fishing vessels in West Point, Washington and Bristol Bay, Alaska. My father is a career fisherman who captains all sorts of vessels and was able to get me these jobs with no prior experience. Working on a boat was and remains to be the most intense, stressful, exhausting and from a personal growth standpoint, satisfying experiences of my life. The first time I was thrown onto a boat I was 21 and had come from a cushy, liberal arts school experience. Although I had been a football player and considered myself pretty tough, I soon realized I had no idea what tough meant. The work was dangerous, the crewmembers were calloused and often mean and there was very little time for rest. When I did get a chance to relax in my bunk in the first few weeks it was commonplace to spend the time having a breakdown. One day, I decided to step up my game and by the end of my time there, I was showing the new crewmembers the ropes (literally). And yes, the beard was an absolute neccesity.  </p>
